# Maximum-Matching-Bipartite-Graph
This project implements a maximum matching algorithm in the bipartite graph using depth-first search (DFS) to find additional paths. This project is a simple task for an algorithm analysis course in a master's degree program.

#description
The script reads an input graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, builds an adjacency list, and then finds the maximum matching using an augmenting path algorithm. The result is printed as the number of matched pairs and the pairs themselves.
